Serialell
=========

Serialell is a connector board companion to any RepRap electronics to allow
both serial or paralell motor connection when an axis is controlled by two
motors.

Usage
-----

Jumpers are named as `JSN` and `JPN`. Simply close all `JSN` jumpers to
connect both motors in _serial_ connection_. Do the sema with all `JPN` jumpers
to make a _paralell_ connection.
